Current Task:
    Create a step by step logic for each round.

    1.When the round starts display whos turn it is.
    2.Give the current user a display of the three words that they are allowed.
    3. Once they choose the word they will have about 1m:20s to complete picture with the limited amount of ink
    4. Allow the other users to guess if the words is correct.
    5. Score Template
        Those who are trying to guess the word
        - Given the time the user guessed the word, we find the percent based on the time they guess.
        - MAX_POINTS = 1000.
        - Ex. user guessing in 30s, 80s-30s = 50s, then 50/80 would be .75;
        -.75 * 1000 = 750 points
        Those who are drawing
        -Based on the average point of every user, we add multipliers of 0.4 for each guess,
        - EX: [.75,.43,.65, .10] = .52,
        - .52 * 1000 = 520 points
