Once the round start we need notify the lobby that their game started. 

Because there is till one person choosing the word before the timer starts,
we need to display that information to other user.

Once the user chooses the words. 
Update the UI by making it clear that the timer has started and the are lines where the words would be.



We need to create a listener with the lobby's chat, and check if that user correctly guessed the words.
